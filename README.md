# Annotating with React

This project was developed as a ride-along to [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-3-CiWy1gYj8FD5C8AfOGJ_BFRMMSIdr#scrollTo=KB0MiG6mphjK&uniqifier=2).  The JSON files that this project is designed to process are those generated by the DataSet's export method. (The prelabeled bounding boxes are in the YOLOv5 format.)

The hook I'm adding is that no mousepress actions are required! The only events that drive this app are mousemove and keypress!

Otherwise overall goal was to copy the funcitionality of Roboflow's built-in annotation editor. 

Hidden Shortcuts:
* enter: next image
* shift: previous image

Visible shortcuts:
* view settings box beneath the labeling area

Note:
The image data is written to LocalStorage to help data persist between refreshes. My hack to switch to a new json file is to use "localStorage.clear()" in the console window.
